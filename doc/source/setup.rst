------------------------------------

#. `Download <https://www.ftrack.com/en/portfolio/perforce>`_ or `build the latest <https://bitbucket.org/ftrack/ftrack-perforce-location/src>`_ integration.
#. `Install the integration <https://help.ftrack.com/en/articles/3504354-ftrack-connect-plugins-discovery-installation-and-update>`_ as ftrack plugin

.. note::

    If you havenâ€™t been logging into perforce for sometime, a login in window will show up asking for username and password.

The workspace root should match the folder created and setup during the perforce user configuration.

.. image:: /image/user-setup-workspace-connect-done.png


This will result in a configuration file written in the ftrack-connect data folder, containing the chosen settings :

Project Configuration
=====================

.. note::

    For this action to appear and run, the user running it should be having super `Access Level <https://www.perforce.com/manuals/v15.1/p4sag/chapter.protections.html>`_ assigned from perforce itself
    and the `right permissions on the ftrack server <https://help.ftrack.com/en/articles/1040544-managing-permissions-and-roles>`_ to add custom attributes.
